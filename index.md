## ðŸ§¬ MutantSim
MutantSim is my Python project for simulating protein outcomes under error-prone polymerase replication.  
It analyzes an mRNA sequence together with a mutation bias matrix and tells you:

- How often the protein remains unchanged  
- How many codons are likely to mutate  
- The probability of premature STOP codons  
- Region-specific mutation risks  

[You can now try it online directly below ðŸ‘‡]
